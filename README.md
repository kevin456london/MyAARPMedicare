# MyAARPMedicare


## Description


MyAARPMedicare is a lightweight React-based sample application intended as a starter template for projects that manage and visualize personal healthcare expense items and receipts. This repository demonstrates a modular structure for small-to-medium React apps, with components for adding expenses, listing them, and showing receipts. While not connected to any live AARP systems or containing private data, the app is a helpful learning tool for developers creating administrative dashboards, expense trackers, or prototypes related to Medicare-style services. It includes clear contribution guidelines, test scaffolding, and a simple, approachable UI to help teams iterate quickly and safely.
